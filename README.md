## why does this repo acually exist here

in this respo i have actually shared basic programmes that i created on the path of learning the languages my self

## what can we see from this repo

- the folder CloudBlogWebApplication

  npm run dev && npm run start
  the server then starts on localhost 4000 with react front end on port 3000 which can be used to see a blog page that can actually be published to get a great website

- the folder CloudBlogWebApplicationTypeScript

  npm run dev
  this is going to show multiple errors in files like blog-post-list-js showing the need of not fully trying to write the code on ts
  this however depends on the user itself
  but as for my suggestion

- the folder tech-soceity

  this is a folder for my school mtes to sidebly view the programmes done and edit them --includes python

- typescript

  node src/index.ts
  this is a basic ts file which gives an out on "/"

- vasudha

  a school project which contains a publishable alexa skill

- webpack

  a intro to basics to advance of the microsft webpack
