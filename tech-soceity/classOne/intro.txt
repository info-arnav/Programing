Basic Plan

basics of atleast one programming language
basic hardware
starting with our first project with iot
integration of project with alexa/google home

the next stage is mastering other language and then getting deeper into it.

personal preference to start with is node js as we can actually see what we do as can even be used for frontend
node js also helps in app and website development
